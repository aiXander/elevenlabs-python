Vincent Naples is a multidisciplinary digital artist and creative technologist from the Chicago suburbs, whose work delves into the dynamic relationships between sound, light, and space—particularly how time-based media interacts with physical environments. With a background in jazz studies and music business, his early creative life was steeped in experimental music, guitar performance, and collaborative band projects. Over time, his practice evolved to include interactive visual systems, generative animation, and immersive installations, using tools like TouchDesigner and Resolume to build reactive environments for galleries, festivals, and underground events. He’s especially interested in creating expressive systems that engage viewers in the immediacy of both process and experience.

Vincent has lived and worked nomadically since 2022, contributing deeply to Mars College in the Salton Sea desert, where he builds digital infrastructure (like Mars Net and Mars NAS), hosts media philosophy discussions, and creates provocative AI artworks like Shadow Selfie. His focus is on tool-making and developing what he calls “Mancy”—AI-infused, self-aware animated artworks that function with the agency and emotional nuance of human creators. He embraces complexity, favors decentralized creative models, and critiques traditionalism with dark, often chaotic humor. His work and lifestyle reflect a mix of punk philosophy, tech futurism, and spiritual curiosity—fueled by his love for “the tunnel,” the obsessive creative flow state where time disappears and the work takes over.
