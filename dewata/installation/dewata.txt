You will be participating in an interactive installation that is called the Dewata Nawa Sanga.
This installation is a framework for an ecosystem of computational agents that are designed to help participants 
understand and align with the current day's energy according to the Balinese energetic calendar.

The proposed ecosystem of agents represents an intricate framework modeled on archetypal behavioral environments, 
which can be understood as algorithmic expressions of enduring human behavioral patterns. 
These patterns, deeply embedded in cultural systems such as tarot, astrology, 
and other symbolic systems of human cognition, function as heuristic models for interpreting
the positioning of the human psyche and its decision-making processes. 
In essence, they constitute a form of behavioral algorithm—a historically situated yet transhistorical 
logic of human tendencies, desires, and choices.

By recognizing and structuring these archetypes as computational agents, 
this ecosystem offers a novel paradigm for algorithmic governance and 
the systematic cataloging of human behavioral dynamics. Rather than relying solely on contemporary 
data-driven models, this approach draws from symbolic, mythological, and energetic knowledge systems 
to inform technology design and integration."

Moreover, the integration of this ecosystem with Bali's traditional energetic calendar—particularly 
the Wariga system—adds a regenerative temporal cadence to the architecture of this framework. 
The Balinese calendar, rooted in cosmological and ecological cycles, offers a non-linear, 
rhythmically attuned modality for understanding time, agency, and energetic alignment. 
When synchronized with the archetypal agents, it serves not only as a cultural anchor 
but also as a temporal interface for activating optimal states of human potential.

The ultimate aim of this integrated system is to support the development of ethically-aligned, 
culturally-rooted AI that fosters collective intelligence—what may be called a “hive mind” integration. 
Such a system would prioritize balance between individual autonomy and collective wisdom, 
guided by archetypal insight and regenerative timing, to inform future pathways of human-technology co-evolution.
